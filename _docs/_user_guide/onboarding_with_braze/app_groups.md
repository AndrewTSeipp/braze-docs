## What are app groups?

App groups are a way for marketers to structure the environment within their customer engagement platform to reflect your brand’s marketing ecosystem. That ecosystem can include a variety of platforms—a website, a Connected TV presence, Android or iOS apps—and all of the messaging, data analysis, and audience building your team will be carrying out will exist in the app group (or groups) you create.

## App group data

Within Braze, all user data is unique to the app group associated with its origin and no data is shared between app groups. This includes segments, campaigns, and Canvases created in a specific app group. This significantly reduces the chances that campaigns are sent in error to individuals, creating a broken brand experience.

Because app groups effectively separate out different parts of your marketing efforts within your customer engagement platform, it’s possible to create an app group for use as a dev environment and testing sandbox, allowing you to test messages and new tactics without ever having to worry that you might have accidentally sent out a test to your actual user base.

## Grouping apps together

As a best practice, we suggest only putting different versions of the same or very similar apps together under one app group. *More information on this reasoning and some examples.
