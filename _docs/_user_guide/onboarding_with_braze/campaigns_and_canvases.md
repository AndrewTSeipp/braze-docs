# Getting started: Campaigns and Canvases

*This is an intro paragraph that covers what this article includes. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.*

- [Campaigns](#campaigns) are best for sending a single message to a group of users, like newsletters, announcements, or promotions.
- [Canvas Flow](#canvas-flow) is best for multi-step user journeys that guide your customers to the next best action, such as onboarding or user retention flows.

## Campaigns

Campaigns are a single message step to connect to your users on channels, more commonly referred to as messaging channels. These messaging channels include Content Cards, email, in-app messages, push, SMS and MMS, and webhooks. By understanding where your customers reside, you can leverage the appropriate messaging channels to communicate.

## Canvas Flow

Canvas Flow is a unified interface where marketers can set up campaigns with multiple messages and steps to form a cohesive journey. A journey, or commonly referred to as a user journey, is an individual user’s experience within the Canvas.

When creating a Canvas, you can control the way your users begin and fulfill their customer journey by editing the entry schedule, target audience, and send settings.

A Canvas is made up of variants—the path each customer follows on their journey. Canvas Flow supports up to eight variants with a control group. You can name each variant and control the distribution of the target audience following each variant. Within each variant are individual steps. A step in Canvas is a marketing decision point that determines your user journey. You can leverage Canvas components to build the steps of your user journey.
