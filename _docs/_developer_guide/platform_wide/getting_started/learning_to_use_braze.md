# Getting started: Learning to use Braze as a developer

> This page includes several reading paths that will enable you to best utilize our platform to your advantage. 

The Braze platform is a complex tool. It offers valuable functionality right from the beginning, with many options for extensibility as your business grows. Because of Braze's beautiful complexity, it does require some thoughtfulness on your end to make sure you're getting everything the platform has to offer. Some coordination with your Marketing team and preplanning during onboarding can ensure you're getting value as quickly as possible from Braze.

To guide your thinking, we recommend the several reading paths that will enable you to best utilize our platform to your advantage. There's no need to follow these exactly&mdash;cater them to your needs! These reading paths assume that you already have a grasp of the basics, so the readings in the Getting Started section aren't included.

{% alert tip %}
Don't forget that you can always access and take [Braze Learning courses](https://learning.braze.com) once you have access to the Braze platform. We highly recommend this in conjunction with these reading paths.
