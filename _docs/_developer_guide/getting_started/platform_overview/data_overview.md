# Getting started: Data overview

> This guide will help you understand what data Braze collects, the difference between a custom event and a custom attribute in Braze, and best practices for managing these analytics.

Data in Braze should always have a purpose. At Braze, data means action. That’s why sending the right data&mdash;not all of the data&mdash;will set your brand up for success. Having only the data you need allows you to more easily identify and target the right people with the right messages. 

{% tabs %}
{% tab underutilized %}
Providing too little data means you may be underutilizing our platform. For example, you might not have enough or the right custom event off of which your marketing team can trigger campaigns.
<br>
![A speedometer barely moving]({% image_buster /assets/img/getting_started/integration-engine-1.jpg %})
{% endtab %}
{% tab inefficient %}
Inefficient data practices and excessive/redundant data across the stack leads to poor marketing performance. Your marketing team might struggle to understand what all the events and attributes are, or be acting off of deprecated ones.
<br>
![A speedometer in the red]({% image_buster /assets/img/getting_started/integration-engine-3.jpg %})
{% endtab %}
{% tab optimal %}
Sending the right data will maximize your messaging effectiveness. Your team can send the right messages to the right people at the right time, without any extra event clutter or overages.
<br> 
It’s hard enough to know what dozens of custom events, attributes, triggers, and what properties are, let alone hundreds or even thousands! Do yourself and your marketers a favor by simplifying and streamlining your data pipelines to only the required values.
<br>

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Before completing your Braze implementation, your marketing team and your development team should discuss your marketing goals. When deciding what you want to track, and how you want to track it with Braze, it's useful to consider these goals and work backward from there. Reference our case of a [Taxi/Ride-Sharing App](#example-case) at the end of this guide for an example of this process.

## User profile
Braze has a concept of a user profile which stores attributes and events for each user. All persistent data associated with a user will be stored against a user profile. 

Anytime you write data to the User Profile it consumes a [data point](#data-points). For example, if the user’s email remains the same but you keep sending us the user email attribute and keep re-writing it, this will charge you a data point every time, so we recommend only sending us that attribute or that event once the data changes.

{% alert important %}
Only send Braze the delta of data. That is, only send updates about attributes and events when they change.
{% endalert %}

Once a user profile is created, either after a user is recognized by the SDK or created via API, there are a number of identifiers that can be assigned to a profile to identify or reference that user. These identifiers include `braze_id` (randomly generated by Braze), `external_id` (which you define), and any number of user aliases (alternate identifiers) that you choose to set.

For detailed information about user profiles, see the [User profile lifecycle][4].

## Data points

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.

For a thorough overview of data points, including what counts and what doesn't, see our [data points article][5].

## Types of data
There are four categories of data within Braze that our SDK and API helps facilitate.

* [Automatically collected data](#automatically-collected-data) is any data that Braze captures and updates automatically about the session and device just simply by initializing our SDK.
* [Standard attributes](#standard-attributes) are common pieces of information that Braze expects to receive about your users regardless of industry or audience, and therefore we have a fixed naming convention for them. Examples of these would be first name, last name, email, date of birth, country, etc.
* [Custom data](#custom-data) are the custom attributes, events, and purchases you define during the onboarding process. These are specific to your use case and brand. A custom attribute might be a shoe size or favorite movie, while renting that movie, or checking in at the store might be a custom event. Custom data includes:
    * [Custom attributes](#custom-attributes) are a collection of your users’ unique traits, defined by your team. These attributes can be in the form of strings, arrays, booleans, numbers, datetimes, objects, and nested objects.
    * [Custom events](#custom-events) are actions taken by, or updates about, your users recorded as time series. A time series records the first and last time an event takes place, as well as the total number of times the event has occurred.
    * [Purchase events](#purchase-events) are similar to regular events, however they have default parameters (`product_id`, `price`, `quantity`) that allow Braze to establish user’s lifetime value.
    * [Event properties](#event-properties) are metadata that can be recorded along with an event or purchase. Event properties can be in the form of strings, arrays, booleans, numbers, datetimes, objects, and nested objects.
* [External data](#external-data) is any data passed from an external source, such as your backend or an API call. Connected Content calls are an example of external data.

{% alert tip %}
Think of attributes, both standard and custom, as adjectives describing the user, while custom events and purchases are verbs, or actions taken by that user.
{% endalert %}

### Automatically collected data

The Braze SDK automatically captures and updates some data that can be used for segmentation and personalization. With the exception of session start and session end, this data does not count towards your data point allocation. You don't need to record them separately as custom events or custom attributes. 

**Useful for**: 
* Basic segmentation
* Usage-based targeting
* Device-based targeting

Here, we see that the automatically collected data is being used to create a segment of users who used your apps more than 0 times in the last 3 days.

![][6]

The following events and attributes are captured and updated automatically by the Braze SDK as part of the session start and session end data points or by the Braze backend. 

#### Usage information
- First Used App (Time)
- Last Used App (Time)
- Total Session Count (Number)
- Number of Feedback Items (Number)
- Number of Sessions in the Last Y Days (Number and Time)
- Email Available (Boolean)

#### Campaign retargeting
- Last Received Any Message (Time)
- Last Received Email Campaign (Time)
- Last Received Push Campaign (Time)
- Clicked Card (Number)
- Received Message from Campaign
  - This filter allows you to target users based on their having (not) received a previous campaign.
- Received Message from Campaign with Tag
  - This filter allows you to target users based on their having (not) received a campaign that currently has a tag.
- Retarget Campaign
  - This filter allows you to target users based on whether or not they have opened, or clicked on a specific email, push, or in-app message in the past.

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}


#### Blocking automatic data collection

It is possible (though not suggested) to block the automatic collection of certain data from your SDK integration, or allowlist processes that do so. 

Blocking data collection is not recommended because removing analytical data reduces your platform's capacity for personalization and targeting. For example:

- If you choose not to fully integrate for location on one of the SDKs, you will not be able to personalize your messaging based on language or location. 
- If you choose not to integrate for time zone, you might not be able to send messages within a user's time zone. 
- If you choose to not integrate for specific device visual information, message content might not be optimized for that device.

We highly recommend completely integrating the SDKs to take full advantage of our product's capabilities.

{% tabs %}
{% tab Web SDK %}

You may either simply not integrate certain parts of the SDK, or use [`disableSDK`](https://js.appboycdn.com/web-sdk/latest/doc/modules/braze.html#disablesdk) for a user. This method will sync data logged prior to when `disableSDK()` was called, and will cause all subsequent calls to the Braze Web SDK for this page and future page loads to be ignored. If you wish to resume data collection at a later point in time, you can use the [`enableSDK()`](https://js.appboycdn.com/web-sdk/latest/doc/modules/braze.html#enablesdk) method in the future to resume data collection. You can learn more about this in our [Disabling Web Tracking]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/web/analytics/disabling_tracking/) article.

{% endtab %}
{% tab Android SDK %}

You can use [`setDeviceObjectAllowlist`](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-android-sdk/kdoc/braze-android-sdk/com.braze.configuration/-braze-config/-builder/set-device-object-allowlist.html?query=fun%20setDeviceObjectAllowlist(deviceObjectAllowlist:%20EnumSet%3CDeviceKey%3E):%20BrazeConfig.Builder) to configure the SDK to only send a subset of the device object keys or values according to a set allowlist. This must be enabled via [`setDeviceObjectAllowlistEnabled`](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-android-sdk/kdoc/braze-android-sdk/com.braze.configuration/-braze-config/-builder/set-device-object-allowlist-enabled.html?query=fun%20setDeviceObjectAllowlistEnabled(enabled:%20Boolean):%20BrazeConfig.Builder).

{% alert important %}
An empty allowlist will result in **no** device data being sent to Braze.
{% endalert %}

{% endtab %}
{% tab iOS SDK %}

You can pass an `appboyOptions` value for `ABKDeviceAllowlistKey` to specify an allowlist for device fields that are collected by the SDK. Fields are defined in `ABKDeviceOptions`. To turn off the collection of all device fields, set the value of this key to `ABKDeviceOptionNone`. Refer to [`Appboy.h`](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/blob/master/AppboyKit/include/Appboy.h) for `appboyOptions` key documentation.

To specify allowlisted device fields, assign the bitwise OR of desired fields to `ABKDeviceAllowlistKey` in the `appboyOptions` object passed to `startWithApiKey`.

{% alert important %}
By default, all fields are collected by the Braze iOS SDK.
{% endalert %}

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}


### Standard attributes

Standard attributes are common pieces of information that many customers collect, regardless of industry or audience. These have fixed naming conventions in Braze. This data does not need to be passed to Braze as custom attributes or events.

**Useful for**: 
* Basic segmentation
* Basic personalization 

At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident, similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga. Et harum quidem rerum facilis est et expedita distinctio. 

### Custom data

Custom data is where Braze starts to become unique to your business. Through logging custom high-value attributes, events, and purchases, we begin to tailor the platform to your use case.

Custom attributes represent adjectives the describe the user, while custom events and purchase events represent verbs or "actions" the user is taking. In addition to these, custom events and purchase events both have the ability to store event properties, which is custom metadata tied to the event. For example, if `watched_movie` was the custom event, `movie_title` might be a property. 

**Useful for:** 
* Advanced segmentation
* Advanced personalization
* Triggering messaging


#### Best practice: Give custom data readable names
Imagine you're a marketer who begins using Braze a year or two after implementation, reading a dropdown list full of names like "usr_no_acct" without further context may be intimidating. Giving your event and attributes identifiable and readable names will make things easier for all users of your platform. Consider the following best-practices:

- Do not begin a custom event with a numeric character. The drop-down list is sorted alphabetically and beginning with a numerical character makes it more difficult to segment by your filter of choice
- Try not to use obscure abbreviations or technical jargon where possible
  - Example: `usr_ctry` may be fine as a variable name for a user's country within a piece of code, but the custom attribute should be sent to Braze as something like `user_country` to lend some clarity to a marketer using the dashboard down the line.
- Avoid programmatically generating custom data names. 
- Capture generic events ("Watched a Video" or "Read an Article") instead of highly specific events such as ("Watched Gangnam Style" or "Read Article: Best 10 Lunch Spots in Midtown Manhattan"). The specific data about the event should be included as an event property, not as part of the event name.

#### Custom data storage

Event properties do not incur data points but are only available for 30 days and the event metadata is only retained for the first and most recent occurrences of the event.

All user profile data (custom events, custom attribute, custom data) is stored as long as those profiles are active.

<!-- What is the incongruity here between persistent event property storage and user profile data? -->

{% alert tip %}
If you want to have more persistent event property storage, we have a feature called Segment Extensions which extend the storage from 30 days to 720 days (2 years).
{% endalert %}

#### Custom events

Custom events are actions taken by your users; they're best suited for tracking high-value user interactions with your application. 

Make generous use of custom event properties to represent important data about an event. For example, rather than capturing a separate custom event for watching each of 50 different movies, it would be more effective to capture simply watching a movie as an event and have an event property that includes the name of the movie.

Logging a custom event can trigger any number of follow-up campaigns with configurable delays, and enables the following segmentation filters around the recency and frequency of that event:

| Segmentation Options | Dropdown Filter | Input Options |
| ---------------------| --------------- | ------------- |
| Check if the custom event has occurred **more than X number of times** | **MORE THAN** | **NUMBER** |
| Check if the custom event has occurred **less than X number of times** | **LESS THAN** | **NUMBER** |
| Check if the custom event has occurred **exactly X number of times** | **EXACTLY** | **NUMBER** |
| Check if the custom event last occurred **after X date** | **AFTER** | **TIME** |
| Check if the custom event last occurred **before X date** | **BEFORE** | **TIME** |
| Check if the custom event last occurred **more than X days ago** | **MORE THAN** | **NUMBER OF DAYS AGO** (Positive) Number) |
| Check if the custom event last occurred **less than X days ago** | **LESS THAN** | **NUMBER OF DAYS AGO** (Positive) Number) |
| Check if the custom event occurred **more than X (Max = 50) number of times** | **MORE THAN** | in the past **Y Days (Y = 1,3,7,14,21,30)** |
| Check if the custom event occurred **less than X (Max = 50) number of times** | **LESS THAN** | in the past **Y Days (Y = 1,3,7,14,21,30)** |
| Check if the custom event occurred **exactly X (Max = 50) number of times** | **EXACTLY** | in the past **Y Days (Y = 1,3,7,14,21,30)** |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 .reset-td-br-3}

Braze notes the number of times these events have occurred as well as the last time they were performed by each user for segmentation. On the **Custom Events** analytics page, you can view in aggregate how often each custom event occurs, as well as by segment over time for more detailed analysis. This is particularly useful to view how your campaigns have affected custom event activity by looking at the gray lines Braze overlays on the time-series to indicate the last time a campaign was sent.

![A custom event analytics graph showing stats on users who added a credit card and made a search across a period of a thirty days.][8]

> [Incrementing custom attributes][9] can be used to keep a counter on a user action similar to a custom event. However, you will not be able to view custom attribute data in a time-series. User actions that do not need to be analyzed in time-series should be recorded via this method.

##### Custom event properties

With custom event properties, Braze allows you to set properties on custom events and purchases. These properties can then be used for further qualifying trigger conditions, increasing personalization in messaging, and generating more sophisticated analytics through raw data export. Property values can be string, number, boolean, or time objects. However, property values cannot be array objects.

For example, if an eCommerce application wanted to send a message to a user when they abandon their cart, it could additionally improve its target audience and allow for increased campaign personalization by adding a custom event property of the 'cart value' of users' carts.

![A custom event example that will send a campaign to a user who has abandoned their cart and left the cart value at more than 100 and less than 200.][10]

Custom event properties can also be used for personalization within the messaging template. Any campaign using [Action-Based Delivery][11] with a trigger event can use custom event properties from that event for messaging personalization. If a gaming application wanted to send a message to users who had completed a level, it could further personalize the message with a property for the time it took users to complete that level. In this example, the message is personalized for three different segments using [conditional logic]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/liquid/conditional_logic/). The custom event property called ``time_spent``, can be included in the message by calling ``{% raw %} {{event_properties.${time_spent}}} {% endraw %}``.

{% raw %}
```liquid
{% if {{event_properties.${time_spent}}} < 600 %}
Congratulations on beating that level so fast! Check out our online portal where you can play against top players fromm around the world!
{% elsif {{event_properties.${time_spent}}} < 1800 %}
Don't forget to visit the town store between levels to upgrade your tools.
{% else %}
Talk to villagers for essential tips on how to beat levels!
{% endif %}
```
{% endraw %}

Custom event properties are designed to help you personalize your messaging or build granular action-based delivery campaigns. If you would like to create segments based on event property recency and frequency, reach out to your customer success manager or our Support team, as this may incur additional data costs.

#### Custom attributes
Custom attributes are extraordinarily flexible tools that allow you to target users with greater specificity than you would with standard attributes. Custom attributes are great for storing brand-specific information about your users. You should keep in mind that we don't store time-series information for custom attributes, so you're not going to get any graphs based on them like the preceding example for custom events.

The following data types may be stored as custom attributes:

##### Strings (alpha-numeric characters)
String attributes are useful for storing user input, such as a favorite brand, a phone number, or a last search string within your application. String attributes can be up to 255 characters long.

The following table describes available segmentation options for string attributes.

| Segmentation Options | Dropdown Filter | Input Options |
| ---------------------| --------------- | ------------- |
| Check if the string attribute **exactly matches** an inputted string| **EQUALS** | **STRING** |
| Check if the string attribute **partially matches** an inputted string **OR** regular expression | **MATCHES REGEX** | **STRING** **OR** **REGULAR EXPRESSION** |
| Check if the string attribute **does not partially match** an inputted string **OR** regular expression | **DOES NOT MATCH REGEX** | **STRING** **OR** **REGULAR EXPRESSION** |
| Check if the string attribute **does not match** an inputted string| **DOES NOT EQUAL** | **STRING** |
| Check if the string attribute **exists** on a user's profile | **IS BLANK** | **N/A** |
| Check if the string attribute **does not exist** on a user's profile | **IS NOT BLANK** | **N/A** |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 .reset-td-br-3}

{% alert important %}
When segmenting using the **DOES NOT MATCH REGEX** filter, it is required that there already exists a custom attribute with a value assigned in that user profile. Braze suggests using "OR" logic to check if a custom attribute is blank in order to ensure users are being targeted properly.
{% endalert %}

{% alert tip %}
For more on how to use our regular expressions filter, check out this documentation on [Perl compatible regular expressions (PCRE)](http://www.regextester.com/pregsyntax.html).

{% endalert %}

##### Arrays
Array attributes are good for storing related lists of information about your users. For example, storing the last 100 pieces of content a user watched within an array would allow specific interest segmentation.

Custom attribute arrays are one-dimensional sets; multi-dimensional arrays are not supported. 

Adding an element to a custom attribute array appends the element to the end of the array, unless it's already present, in which case it gets moved from its current position to the end of the array. For example, if an array `['hotdog','hotdog','hotdog','pizza']` were imported, it will show in the array attribute as `['hotdog', 'pizza']` because only unique values are supported.

If the array contains its maximum number of elements, the first element will be discarded and the new element added to the end. The following lists some example code showing the array behavior in the web SDK:

```
var abUser = appboy.getUser();
// initialize array for this user, assuming max length of favorite_foods is set to 4.
abUser.setCustomUserAttribute('favorite_foods', ['pizza', 'wings', 'pasta']); // => ['pizza', 'wings', 'pasta']
abUser.addToCustomAttributeArray('favorite_foods', 'fries'); // => ['pizza', 'wings', 'pasta', 'fries']
abUser.addToCustomAttributeArray('favorite_foods', 'pizza'); // => ['wings', 'pasta', 'fries', 'pizza']
abUser.addToCustomAttributeArray('favorite_foods', 'ice cream'); // => ['pasta', 'fries', 'pizza', 'ice cream']

```

The maximum number of elements in custom attribute arrays defaults to 25. The maximum for individual arrays can be increased to up to 100 in the Braze dashboard, under **Manage Settings > Custom Attributes**. If you would like this maximum increased, reach out to your customer service manager. Arrays exceeding the maximum number of elements will be truncated to contain the maximum number of elements.

The following table describes available segmentation options for array attributes.

| Segmentation Options | Dropdown Filter | Input Options |
| ---------------------| --------------- | ------------- |
| Check if the array attribute **includes a value which exactly matches** an inputted value| **INCLUDES VALUE** | **STRING** |
| Check if the array attribute **does not include a value which exactly matches** an inputted value| **DOESN'T INCLUDE VALUE** | **STRING** |
| Check if the array attribute **contains a value which partially matches** an inputted value **OR** regular expression | **MATCHES REGEX** | **STRING** **OR** **REGULAR EXPRESSION** |
| Check if the array attribute **has any value** | **HAS A VALUE** | **N/A** |
| Check if the array attribute **is empty** | **IS EMPTY** | **N/A** |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 .reset-td-br-3}

>  We use [Perl compatible regular expressions (PCRE)][12].

##### Dates
Time attributes are useful for storing the last time a specific action was taken, so you can offer content specific re-engagement messaging to your users.

> The last date a custom event or purchase event occurred is automatically recorded, and should not be recorded in duplicate via a custom time attribute.

Date filters using relative dates (e.g., more than 1 day ago, less than 2 days ago) measure 1 day as 24 hours. Any campaign that you run using these filters will include all users in 24 hour increments. For example, last used app more than 1 day ago will capture all users who "last used the app more than 24 hours" from the exact time the campaign runs. The same will be true for campaigns set with longer date ranges – so five days from activation will mean the prior 120 hours.

The following table describes available segmentation options for time attributes.

| Segmentation Options | Dropdown Filter | Input Options |
| ---------------------| --------------- | ------------- |
| Check if the time attribute **is before** a **selected date**| **BEFORE** | **CALENDAR DATE SELECTOR** |
| Check if the time attribute **is after** a **selected date**| **AFTER** | **CALENDAR DATE SELECTOR** |
| Check if the time attribute is **more than X number** of **days ago** | **MORE THAN** | **NUMBER OF DAYS AGO** |
| Check if the time attribute is **less than X number** of **days ago**| **LESS THAN** | **NUMBER OF DAYS AGO** |
| Check if the time attribute is **in more than X number** of **days in the future** | **IN MORE THAN** | **NUMBER OF DAYS IN FUTURE** |
| Check if the time attribute is **less than X number** of **days in the future** | **IN LESS THAN** | **NUMBER OF DAYS IN FUTURE**  |
| Check if the time attribute **exists** on a user's profile | **BLANK** | **N/A** |
| Check if the time attribute **does not exist** on a user's profile | **IS NOT BLANK** | **N/A** |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 .reset-td-br-3}

##### Numbers {#integers}
Numeric attributes have a wide variety of use cases. Incrementing number custom attributes are useful for storing the number of times a given action or event has occurred. Standard numbers have all sorts of usages, such as recording shoe size, waist size, or the number of times a user has viewed a certain product feature or category.

> Money spent should not be recorded by this method. Rather it should be recorded via our [purchase methods](#purchase-events).

The following table describes available segmentation options for numeric attributes.

| Segmentation Options | Dropdown Filter | Input Options |
| ---------------------| --------------- | ------------- |
| Check if the numeric attribute **is more than** a **number**| **MORE THAN** | **NUMBER** |
| Check if the numeric attribute **is less than** a **number**| **LESS THAN** | **NUMBER** |
| Check if the numeric attribute **is exactly** a **number**| **EXACTLY** | **NUMBER** |
| Check if the numeric attribute **does not equal** a **number**| **DOES NOT EQUAL** | **NUMBER** |
| Check if the numeric attribute **exists** on a user's profile | **EXISTS** | **N/A** |
| Check if the numeric attribute **does not exist** on a user's profile | **DOES NOT EXIST** | **N/A** |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 .reset-td-br-3}

##### Booleans (true/false)
Boolean attributes are useful for storing subscription statuses and other simple binary data about your users. The input options that we provide allow you to find users that have explicitly had a variable set to a boolean in addition to those that don't have any record of that attribute recorded yet.

The following table describes available segmentation options for boolean attributes.

| Segmentation Options | Dropdown Filter | Input Options |
| ---------------------| --------------- | ------------- |
| Check if the boolean value **is** | **IS**  | **TRUE**, **FALSE**, **TRUE OR NOT SET**, or **FALSE OR NOT SET** |
| Check if the boolean value **exists** on a user's profile | **EXISTS**  | **N/A** |
| Check if the boolean value **does not exist** on a user's profile | **DOES NOT EXIST**  | **N/A** |
{: .reset-td-br-1 .reset-td-br-2 .reset-td-br-3}


#### Purchase events

Using our purchase methods to record in-app purchases establishes the Life-time Value (LTV) for each individual user profile. This data is viewable within our revenue page in time-series graphs.

The following table describes available segmentation options for purchase events.

>  If you would like to segment on the number of times a specific purchase has occurred, you should also record that purchase individually as an [incrementing custom attribute](#numbers-integers).

{% alert tip %}
Purchase events are generally logged at the product level, however order name or category can be used in place of `product_id`.

**Useful for:** 
* Advanced segmentation
* Advanced personalization
* Triggering messaging


## Taxi/ride-sharing app use case {#example-case}
For this example, let's consider a ride-sharing app that wants to decide what user data to collect. The following questions and brainstorming process are a great model for marketing and development teams to follow. By the end of this exercise, both teams should have a solid understanding of what custom events and attributes make sense to collect in order to help meet their goal.

**Case Question #1: What is the goal?**

Their goal is straightforward in that they want users to hail taxi rides via their app.

**Case Question #2: What are the intermediate steps on the way to that goal from app installation?**

1. They need users to begin the registration process and fill out their personal information.
2. They need users to complete and verify the registration process by inputting a code into the app they receive via SMS.
3. They need to attempt to hail a taxi.
4. In order to hail a taxi, they must be available when they search.

These actions could then be tagged as the following custom events:

- Began Registration
- Completed Registration
- Successful Taxi Hails
- Unsuccessful Taxi Hails

After implementing the events, you can now run the following campaigns:

1. Message users who Began Registration, but didn't trigger the Completed Registration event in a certain time frame.
2. Send congratulation messages to users who complete registration.
3. Send apologies and promotional credit to users who had unsuccessful taxi hails that weren't followed by a successful taxi hail within a certain amount of time.
4. Send promotions to power users with lots of Successful Taxi Hails to thank them for their loyalty.

And many more!

**Case Question #3: What other information might we want to know about our users that will inform our messaging?**

- Whether or not they have any promotional credits?
- The average rating they give to their drivers?
- Unique promo codes for the user?

These characteristics could then be tagged as the following custom attributes:

- Promotional Credit Balance (Decimal Type)
- Average Driver Rating (Number Type)
- Unique Promo Code (String Type)

Adding these attributes would afford you the ability to send campaigns to users, such as:

1. Remind users who haven't logged on in seven days but who have a promotional credit that their credit exists and they should come back to the app to use it!
2. Message users who give low driver ratings to get direct customer feedback to see why they didn't enjoy their rides.
3. Use our [message templating and personalization features][7] to drag the unique promotion code attribute into messaging directed at users.


## Technical limitations and constraints
Be mindful of the following limitations and constraints when implementing custom events.

### Length constraints
All custom events, custom attribute names (keys), and custom event string values of 255 characters or longer will be truncated. Ideally, these should be as short as possible to improve network and battery performance for your app. If possible limit them to 50 characters.

### Content constraints
The following content will be trimmed programmatically from your attributes and events. Take care not to use the following:

- Leading and trailing whitespace
- Newlines
- All non-digits within phone numbers
  - Example: "(732) 178-1038" will be condensed to "7321781038"
- Non-whitespace characters must be converted into spaces
- $ should not be used as a prefix for any custom events
- Any invalid UTF-8 encoding values
  -  "My \x80 Field" would be condensed to "My Field"

### Reserved keys
The following keys are reserved and cannot be used as custom event properties:

- `time`
- `product_id`
- `quantity`
- `event_name`
- `price`
- `currency`

### Value definitions

- Integer values are 64 bit
- Decimals have 15 decimal digits by default
